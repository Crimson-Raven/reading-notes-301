### Lab 07

### What are some common use cases for NGINX?
NGINX delivers content lightning fast, acts as a traffic director for websites (reverse proxy), balances workloads across servers, speeds things up by caching frequently accessed content, offers some security protection, and is useful for complex web applications (microservices)

### How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?
NGINX acts as a buffer between the user and the web server, efficiently handling resource-intensive tasks and optimizing the overall performance of your web application.
NGINX uses a smarter way to handle connections (event-driven architecture), remembers frequently used content (caching), spreads the work across multiple servers (load balancing), and takes care of heavy lifting before requests reach the server (acting as a reverse proxy).
By doing all this, NGINX lets the web server focus on its core tasks and keeps things running smoothly.

### Describe, as if to a non-technical friend, how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might choose to use it.
Say "engine-ex" for NGINX. 
Lightning speed: Imagine your website as a race car. NGINX makes sure it loads lightning fast, so visitors don't get stuck waiting at the starting line. 
Traffic cop: Ever been stuck in a massive traffic jam online? NGINX acts like a traffic cop, directing visitors to the right parts of your website without any crashes or slowdowns.
Bodyguard: Just like a bodyguard protects a celebrity, NGINX can add some security to your website. It helps keep bad guys out and your website safe from online attacks.
Multitasking master: Think of NGINX as a website Swiss Army knife! It can handle all sorts of tasks, from showing images, to remembering things visitors have looked at before, all to make their experience smoother.
