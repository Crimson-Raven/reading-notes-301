### Lab 11

### What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?
Regular computers are all-purpose tools, like a decent kitchen knife. Servers are specialists, like a chef's knife - powerful and built for one specific task all the time (e.g., storing files, running websites, handling emails). They're stronger and more reliable for constant work.

### How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?
Windows Home and Pro get updates automatically and frequently, with a focus on security and some new features. Windows Server offers more control through WSUS. Admins can choose which updates to install, when to deploy them, or even delay them for testing. Server updates are slower and focus primarily on security fixes to keep things stable. It's like fast-food for home users and a customizable menu for server admins.

### Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
Windows Server needs beefier hardware than Windows Home or Pro. Servers handle demanding tasks and require more processing power, memory, and storage to run smoothly. Reliability is crucial, so features like error-correcting memory are often essential. Security is another focus, with hardware features like TPM sometimes required for encryption.  Basically, Windows Server is a heavy-duty truck needing a powerful engine, while Windows Home/Pro are like everyday cars with less demanding needs.
